# Dominant-color-extraction
# Here we have to extract the dominant color at various parts of images,for this we will us K means clustering algorithm 
# So that means we are extracting K most dominant colors in an image
# We randomly cant take some value for k, For this we will use Elbow method to find out optimum K value
#  Now using K means clustering we will divide data into K clusters
# In our case all pixels are data points having (R,G,B) values and K most dominant colors finally divide image into K clusters having those colors
